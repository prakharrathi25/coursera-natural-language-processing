# Natural Language Processing Specialisation 

<p align="center"><img width="50%" src="specialisation-banner.jpg" /></p>

This repo contains all my work for this specialization. All the code base, quiz questions, screenshot, and images, are taken from, unless specified, [Natural Language Processing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing) on Coursera offered by deeplearning.ai. 

**Instructor**: [Prof. Andrew Ng](www.andrewng.org)

## Reminder 

As a CS major student and a long-time self-taught learner, I have completed many CS related MOOCs on Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, and Edx. I do understand the hard time you spend on understanding new concepts and debugging your program. The reason I am creating this repository is purely for academic use (in case for my future use). I am really glad if you can use it as a reference and happy to discuss with you about issues related with the course even further deep learning techniques.

Please only use it as a reference. The quiz and assignments are relatively easy to answer, hope you can have fun with the courses. Open to contribution by others.
